    "\n",
    "'r' (Read Mode): This is the default mode. It opens the file for reading. If the file doesn't exist or cannot be opened for some reason, it raises a FileNotFoundError. You can only read from the file in this mode.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "'w' (Write Mode): It opens the file for writing. If the file exists, it truncates it (removes all the contents) before writing. If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new file.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "'a' (Append Mode): It opens the file for appending new content to the end of the file. If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new file.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "'b' (Binary Mode): This mode is used to open the file in binary mode. It is used in combination with other modes like 'rb' or 'wb'. This mode is mainly used for non-text files like images or executable files.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "'+' (Read/Write Mode): This mode allows you to read and write to the file. It's used in combination with other modes like 'r+', 'w+', or 'a+'. It means you can perform both read and write operations on the file.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "'x' (Exclusive Creation Mode): This mode is used for exclusive creation, which means it opens the file for exclusive creation and fails if the file already exists.\n",
