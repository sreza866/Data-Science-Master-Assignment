    "\n",
    "1. <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em;\"><b>Encapsulation</b>:Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It hides the internal state of objects from the outside world and only exposes the necessary functionality through methods. This helps in preventing unauthorized access and modification of data.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em;\"><b>Abstraction</b>:Abstraction refers to the concept of hiding the complex implementation details of a class and only showing the essential features of the object. It allows programmers to focus on what an object does rather than how it achieves it. Abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces, which provide a blueprint for creating concrete classes.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em;\"><b>Inheritance</b>:Inheritance is a mechanism by which a new class (subclass or derived class) is created from an existing class (superclass or base class), inheriting its attributes and methods. It promotes code reuse and facilitates the creation of a hierarchical structure of classes. Subclasses can extend or override the behavior of their superclass while inheriting its common functionality.</span> \n",
    "\n",
    "4. <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em;\"><b>Polymorphism</b>:Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables objects to be processed uniformly by providing a way to perform a single action in different ways. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism). It enhances flexibility and extensibility in object-oriented systems.</span> \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size: 0.8em;\">These four pillars together provide the foundation for building robust, modular, and maintainable software systems using the principles of object-oriented programming.</span>\n"
